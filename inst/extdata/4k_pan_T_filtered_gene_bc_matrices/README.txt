4k Pan T Cells from a Healthy Donor
Single Cell Gene Expression Dataset by Cell Ranger 2.1.0

Pan T cells isolated from mononuclear cells of a healthy donor (same donor as t_3k). T cells are primary cells with relatively small amounts of RNA (~1pg RNA/cell).

4,538 cells detected
Sequenced on Illumina Hiseq4000 with approximately 73,000 reads per cell
26bp read1 (16bp Chromium barcode and 10bp UMI), 98bp read2 (transcript), and 8bp I7 sample barcode
Analysis run with --expect-cells=6000
