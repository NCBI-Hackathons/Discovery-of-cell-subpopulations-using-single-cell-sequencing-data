Discovery of cell subpopulations using sigle cell sequencing data and ReSET

What is ReSET (Robust Subpopulation dEcision Trees)?

ReSET is a tool for discovering robust populations derived from single cell RNA-Seq experiments.

Overview

Single-cell RNA sequencing enables unbiased analysis of expression patterns, but researchers don’t have the tools for appropriate decision making during the analysis. Our general aim is to introduce unbiased data-driven strategies to identify the appropriate number of robust subpopulations, their discriminatory defining markers and the relationships between populations. I outlined a solid plan below, but it is open for innovative ideas, improvements and suggestions.
